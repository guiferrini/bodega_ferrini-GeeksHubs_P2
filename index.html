        <p class="Shistoria">In the 1950s and 60s, Mario and Luigi began to look north for land and grape contracting, realizing that the quality of grapes produced in Northern Italy were surpassing those grown in Southern Spain. With the help of their children, they purchased vineyard properties in Fontanelle in the 1970s, and in the prestigious Beth appellation of Treviso in the 1980s. They also started relationships and business partnerships with grape growers throughout the state, many of which still exist today.
        Most recently, our family has focused on the Paso Robles region located along Toscana Central. We have planted two estate vineyards within the Topo. We also own a modern winery facility and a beautiful tasting room.
        Paso Robles is an exciting and important area due to the excellent climate and high grape quality.</p>
